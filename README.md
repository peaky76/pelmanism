# Pelmanism

A Javascript version of the classic memory game, aka Concentration or Pairs.

# Rules

1. Turn over a card by clicking on it.
2. Turn over a second card, trying to find one that matches.
3. If a pair of cards match, they are removed from the game. If they don't, they're turned back over and play continues.
4. The game is won when all cards are removed.

# Development notes

Basic game logic is taken from freeCodeCamp's [Learn Javascript by Building Games tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc&feature=emb_logo), with the following extra features/bug fixes:

- Loopholes in the logic plugged (double-clicking the same card, being able to turn over 'dead' cards)
- Additional styling
